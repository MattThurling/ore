# Open Rights Engine (ORE)

> Self-custodial encryption and access control for music and media.

This is an early work-in-progress SDK.  
The goal: let creators encrypt tracks and users decrypt them locally,
using self-custodied keys, with optional NFT/rights integration.

## Install

```bash
npm install open-rights-engine
